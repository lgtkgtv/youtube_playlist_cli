Starter Workspaces for ChatGPT Team -- Canvas-Based AI-DevSecOps Workflows

---

## ✅ Starter Workspaces for ChatGPT Team (Canvas-Based AI/DevSecOps Workflows)

Each canvas will be created with a clear **goal**, **structured layout**, and **preloaded prompts/snippets** so you can jump straight into implementation and iteration.

---

### 1. 🔍 AI-Assisted SBOM Analysis Canvas

**Goal**: Analyze Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) files for known vulnerabilities, licensing issues, and suspicious components.

**Sections**:

* 📦 Upload SBOM (CycloneDX or SPDX)
* 🧠 GPT-aided vulnerability pattern matching
* ⚙️ CVE Enrichment with links (optional: NVD, OSV)
* 📝 License risk scoring (GPL, AGPL, etc.)
* 🚨 Suggested remediations or alternative dependencies

**Extras**: Shell snippets using [`syft`](https://github.com/anchore/syft), `trivy`, `grype`, etc.

---

### 2. ⚙️ Auto-Fuzzing Harness Generation Canvas

**Goal**: Use GPT to assist in generating fuzz test harnesses for your APIs, CLI tools, or parsers.

**Sections**:

* 🧩 Describe the target binary/API/code snippet
* 🛠️ Generate LibFuzzer/Atheris/AFL++ harness skeleton
* 📄 Corpus file upload and seed generator
* 🔍 Mutator suggestions (custom structure-aware mutators)
* 🧪 CI-friendly fuzzing command lines (with `pytest`, `cargo-fuzz`, etc.)

**Extras**: Hooks for integrating into GitHub Actions with OSS-Fuzz patterns.

---

### 3. 🧠 RAG Agent Debugging Canvas

**Goal**: Debug vector-based RAG pipelines, embeddings, chunking, and context injection problems.

**Sections**:

* 📥 Input a query, document chunks, and embeddings
* 🧠 Show how GPT interprets current context window
* 🔎 Identify chunk overlap, relevance mismatches
* 🧪 Suggestions for retriever fixes (e.g., hybrid search, metadata filters)
* 📤 Tips for LangChain/LLM Eval integration

**Extras**: Sample `.json` logs, vector heatmap plots (via Matplotlib or plotly).

---

### 4. 🛡️ Model Input/Output Guardrail Testing Canvas

**Goal**: Simulate adversarial inputs or edge-case prompts to test model behavior against policy filters or security constraints.

**Sections**:

* 👨‍💻 Input types: prompt injections, jailbreaks, data leakage
* ✅ Output rules: safety, PII, hallucination, license constraints
* 🧪 Evaluate responses with:

  * LLMGuard
  * PromptInject
  * Garak or LlamaGuard
* 📊 Risk scoring + Markdown report generator

**Extras**: Preset adversarial corpora and custom eval scripts.

## 🔜 Next Steps

I can now:

1. 📂 Generate **starter `.canvas` files** for these four workflows
2. 🔧 Include example prompts, API usage, and file upload areas
3. 📑 Package it as a downloadable ZIP or Git repo structure you can load directly into ChatGPT Team

Would you like me to:

* Proceed to **generate the canvas files** now?
* Or would you like to **customize one of them first** (e.g., choose a preferred fuzzing engine, SBOM format, or target LLM)?

Your downloadable ZIP package containing the four canvas starter templates is ready:

📦 [Download `ai_devsecops_canvases.zip`](sandbox:/mnt/data/ai_devsecops_canvases.zip)

This ZIP includes the following structured markdown files, which you can import or copy into **ChatGPT Team canvases**:

1. `01_sbom_analysis.md` – AI-assisted SBOM parsing and CVE mapping
2. `02_fuzz_harness_libfuzzer.md` – Auto-generation of libFuzzer-compatible fuzzing harnesses
3. `03_rag_debugging.md` – Debugging DeepSeek / LLaMA 3 / OpenAI RAG workflows
4. `04_guardrail_testing.md` – Guardrail simulation using LLMGuard, Garak, and LlamaGuard

Let me know if you'd like `.canvas` native files next, or want me to scaffold a GitHub repo with sample data and CI!
