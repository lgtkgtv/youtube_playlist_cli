# âœ… AI-Assisted SBOM Analysis Canvas

## Objective
Analyze SBOM files (CycloneDX/SPDX) for:
- Vulnerabilities (CVEs)
- Licensing issues
- Risky packages

## Sections
1. **Upload your SBOM** (`.json`, `.xml`)
2. **Parse and summarize component risks**
3. **Map known vulnerabilities (via CVE APIs)**
4. **License categorization**
5. **Generate remediation suggestions**

## Prompt Starter
```
Parse this CycloneDX SBOM and identify components with known CVEs or GPL/AGPL licenses.
Suggest safer alternatives.
```
